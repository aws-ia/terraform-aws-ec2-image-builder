# AWS EC2 Image Builder Module

This terraform module can be used to deploy [AWS EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/).

   ✅ Deployment examples can be found under [examples](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-ec2-image-builder/tree/main/examples) folder.

## Usage

The example below builds an EC2 Image using EC2 Image Builder in an existing VPC and Subnets.
EC2 Image Builder simplifies the building, testing, and deployment of Virtual Machine and container images for use on AWS or on-premises.
EC2 Image Builder supporting resources EC2 Key Pair, IAM role and Security groups are created by this module by default.
This module allows you to bring your own EC2 Key Pair, additional IAM Policy and Security group.

The following is a basic example, see examples folder for more complete examples:

```hcl
